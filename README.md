## What is GptSh?

It's a fork of [ptSh](https://github.com/jszczerbinsky/ptSh), because ptSh doesn't look active.

GptSh are visually customizable termianal utils. GptSh main purpose is to be pleasing to the eye and be as powerful as
the original coreutils. The conception of GptSh visual configuration is, that there is only one common config file for all
utils. Because of this all GptSh utils will print errors, information about files, dirs etc. the same way.

## Available commands
Note, that GptSh is still in beta release and it doesn't provide full functionality yet.

| Command | Alternative for | Description |

| gptpwd | pwd | Shows path to current directory |
| gptls | ls | Lists files in current directory |
| gptcp | cp | Copies files or directories |
